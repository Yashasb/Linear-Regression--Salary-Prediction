I have implemented the salary prediction model in python and jupyter notebook.

Feature selection:
I have selected the following features to build the model:
1)Job group code
2)Job Code
3)Union code.
4)Department name.
5)Worker group code.


I have selected these features because they are unique attributes and has the hieghest wieghtage combination comapared to all other combinations of features.

The model was created using linear regression and the coeffiecients are as follows:
array([-1078.05919067,    36.32895972,    -2.26063786,   -35.61269195, -57.97721512])

The intercept derived from the above model is 
14151.680554308256
